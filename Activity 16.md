### Class Employee
1. Create a class Employee
```python
class Employee:
    pass
```
### Input SS#
2. Create a procedure that has an argument of type Employee and inputs their SS# into Employee.ss (substitute you instance variable for Employee here). Your code should validate that a valid SS# is put in.
3. Create an exception InvalidSocial. In the event that an invalid ss# is typed in raise this exception.
